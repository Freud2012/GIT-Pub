****Setting up your "database"****
When setting up, you created a file calledÂ `drinks.js`in yourÂ `models`folder. For now, this will act as our "database".

**InsideÂ `drinks.js`, paste the following dataÂ *as is***You may notice that the image url's are missing a certain something, but this isÂ *intentional!*Â DoÂ **not**Â directly edit any of the provided data inside yourÂ `drinks.js`file. We'll fix things programmatically!

`D`r
â€¢ Set up your 'database' so that it can be exported to yourÂ `server.js`and then be required by yourÂ `server.js`
â€¢ Set this 'database' to a variable called drinks in yourÂ `server.js`file
â€¢ Create a get routeÂ `/drinks`that willÂ `res.send(drinks)`, which will display your drinks data as json in the browserğŸ”´Â *Remember to commit!*
****Setting up your index view****
â€¢ Instead of displaying json at your /drinks route, you should serve theÂ `drinks_index.ejs`file you created that will display your drinks
**InÂ `drinks_index.ejs`**
â€¢ Start with your HTML boilerplate
â€¢ Add anÂ `<h1>`that describes the page, i.e.Â `Welcome to gitPub`
â€¢ Add aÂ `<style>`tag so you can write some CSSÂ *directly*Â inside yourÂ `html`file.
    â—¦ See more infoÂ [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)
    â—¦ Wondering how you can connect a separateÂ `.css`file? We'll learn about it later, or you can look at the Hungry for More section that will point you in the right direction to research!
â€¢ Add aÂ `background-color`and textÂ `color`to toÂ `body`so that you can ensure your css is working correctly
    â—¦ For example:

`<style type="text/css">
  body {
    color: blanchedalmond;
    background-color: steelblue;
  }
</style>`
â€¢ Change yourÂ `/drinks`route toÂ `res.render`yourÂ `drinks_index.ejs`
â€¢ In your browser, go toÂ `localhost:3000/drinks`to make sure you're rendering theÂ `drinks_index.ejs`file!ğŸ”´Â *Remember to commit!*
****Setting up your index view to show your drinks data****
**In yourÂ `drinks_index.ejs`, make it so that you can see:***
â€¢ The name of each drink as a list item inside an unordered list
â€¢ This list should be dynamically rendered by ejs based on your data from your 'database'
â€¢ You'll notice the drink names aren't properly capitalized! Let's fix that! Manipulate the data programatically to capitalize the first letter of their namesğŸ”´Â *Remember to commit!*
****Setting up your show route****
**InÂ `server.js`**
â€¢ Add a new get route forÂ `/drinks/:id`
â€¢ For now, just make sure it works correctly by having the routeÂ `res.send(req.params.id)`
    â—¦ So that when you go toÂ `localhost:3000/drinks/whatever`,Â `whatever`should show up in the browserğŸ”´Â *Remember to commit!*
****LinkingÂ `drinks_index.ejs`toÂ `drinks_show.ejs`**
**InÂ `index.ejs`**
â€¢ Make each listed drink a link that will go to the routeÂ `/drinks/x`, where 'x' is the array position of the drink in the data array. This should be set dynamically with ejs!
â€¢ When you click the link, it show go to the show route and the index number corresponding to the drink's array position should be displayedğŸ”´Â *Remember to commit!*
****Rendering an individual drink in the show view****
**InÂ `show.ejs`**
â€¢ Copy/paste your code from yourÂ `drinks_index.ejs`into yourÂ `drinks_show.ejs`
    â—¦ surely, there must be a better way to not copy/paste; are you wondering if there is something in the hungry for more section about this?
â€¢ Change all your html code inside yourÂ `drinks_show.ejs`file'sÂ `<body>`so that:
    â—¦ YourÂ `h1`tag says "At foo bar"
    â—¦ There's anÂ `h2`tag that should display the name of the drink
    â—¦ There's an image tag that should display the image of the drink
    â—¦ There's anÂ `h3`tag that should display the price of the drink
    â—¦ Add an anchor tag with the text of back, that will take you back to your index.ejs view
**InÂ `server.js`**
â€¢ Update the get route to render theÂ `show`view with the drinks data
Oh no! If you check on the browser, the image is broken because in our database the image links don't have theÂ `.png`ending, let's fix that programatically!
â€¢ Without going back to theÂ `drinks.js`database file and editing it there, add onÂ `.png`to the end of the drink's image data programatically
    â—¦ *Thought question:*Â Where should you do this? server.js or show.ejs? Or does it not matter, i.e. will either one work?ğŸ”´Â *Remember to commit!*
Our gitPub is missing some food, so let's add some!
1. Add a second 'database' by creating aÂ `food.js`file in theÂ `models`folder and use the following data:

1. List the food under your drinks list on the index ( food_index.js )
2. Make them clickable as well to go to their show page ( food_show.js )

### ****Hungry for More?****

1. Look into EJS partials and try to implement them in your app! Create a partial for the head, and include it in both your views. We'll have a morning exercise covering partials later in the unit, but if you'd like to look into it now, a nice walkthrough can be foundÂ [here (starts about 1/4 of the way down)](https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application)

2. Style your application with Bootstrap or any other CSS framework! Or really jazz up your app by adding some hand-rolled flourishes with css animations, jQuery and more!

3. Sign up forÂ [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)Â and try out a challenge (or a few!) in order to keep honing your JavaScript skills!

4. Learn about express static in order to learn how to link a css file to your app (we'll be covering it tomorrow, but if you're interested in looking into it now:Â [read those docs!](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html)) Go ahead and dive right in!

****Style your app****

â€¢ Just use style tags for now!
â€¢ STRETCH: Add a little more flair to your gitPub app by styling it with a little bit of CSS. Doesn't have to be anything crazy, just make it so that it's not the default styling!

****Deliverables****

An express app that meets all the user stories outlined in the beginning of this markdown.
****Technical Requirements****

*Your app MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above explaining what is wrong*
